=>What are the advantages of Django Form over HTML form?

1) One major advantage that Django's form class gives is validation. This is the biggest advantage of Django's form class. 
   It was built with validation being the key.

2) Django's form class provides validation on many forms. For example, if you create a form and there are many blank fields 
   (by default all fields are required meaning a user must enter in a value), the form will be submitted; the user will be told 
   to fill in the blank fields before the form is submitted.

3) Django's form class also provides validation with many different types of data entry. For example, 
   it has an EmailField that validates email address. So, if a user types in, 'Peter' as his email, 
   Django's form states that this is not a valid email address.

4) So validation is the corner of Django's form class. It is an excellent validating tool to make sure 
   that all fields of the form are filled and appropriate for what is being asked.

5) Another advantage of Django forms is gives ease of use when putting the data taken from a form to a database table.
   You can use the same variable that makes the form fields and insert the values from them into a database table.
   It provides ease of use when taking data from a form and inserting the data into a database. 
   If you are doing this, Django's form are very suitable and makes this process simpler.
